### About Workshop

A remote workshop catered to the alumni network of Galvanize and Hack Reactor. Attendees of the workshop built a serverless application that uses Artificial Intelligence to conduct facial recognition and uses Courier to send alerts based on the results.

### Contributions

Demonstrated the following steps to the attendees:
    - Creating a serverless application using Azure functions
    - Sending single and multi-channel notifications from the Azure function
    - Using Insomnia and Postman to test Post requests

During individual review of the project prior to the live workshop, I found that the intended use of Azure to recognize emotions was no longer supported and flagged this issue to the team so we could alter the project to make use of supported features.
